Day 1 | Exercise 2
Basic Grid:

Create a new HTML document and name it bootstrap-i1.html. You can use the same content from the previous example (Basic Exercise 1 and 2), but this time divide the text content into 7 paragraphs (yes, an uneven number!).

For large screens, use a grid of three rows with three columns for the content.  Wrap the text paragraphs in a way that every paragraph occupies a single grid element. On extra-small screens, each paragraph should be shown as a single column in a row.

Now try to change the way these paragraphs are shown on medium and small screens. Feel free to experiment with the number of columns per row. 


Basic Grid 2:
Create a new HTML document and name it bootstrap-i2.html. You can use Lorem Ipsum as a text filler, but this time divide the text content into 13 paragraphs. Wrap the text paragraphs in a way that every paragraph occupies a single grid element.

You should end up with a grid of five rows and three columns on large screen. On medium screens, each row should have two paragraphs/columns. On small screens you should have two columns per row and on extra small screens you should have one column per row.
